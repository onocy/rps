# Issues
- Opponent wins on ties, and wins when you win. You only win when the opponent loses
- Text stays static on return
    - Should be mapped to choice (yours & opponents)
- Win count functionality is unimplemented
    - Should be a message once win count is reached. 

- Functions should be made so that they each have one purpose, and do not do an excessive amount.
